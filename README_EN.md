### **About**

The `CodeFever` project was initially developed and maintained by `PGYER` and went live in June 2020 [https://codefever.pgyer.com/](https://codefever.pgyer.com/). After nearly two years of stability verification, the project was open sourced in February 2022 to be tested by the community.

After `CodeFever` open source, the open source version is called `CodeFever Conmmunity` version. The public cloud version will continue to be called `CodeFever`.

`CodeFever Community` is developed by the `PGYER` team and is fully open source based on the `MIT` license, and has completely independent property rights, so you can use it without worrying about whether it violates other's rights.

`CodeFever Community` retains most of the features of `CodeFever` and is optimized for standalone deployment. `CodeFever Community` also accepts community submissions as `CodeFever` is updated.
